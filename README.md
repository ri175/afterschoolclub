Demonstrating how to use Git for CST3145 2020

this is my first change.


I will be including the github link below:
https://ri175.github.io/afterschoolclub/

you should be able to see the commits. Please read them as there seem's to be an issue where i have had to update github manually instead of it updating directly throught visual studio code.


I am still having issues with GitHub. I am still having to manually add everything in.



All relevant files were added and images were removed and re-added because of the change in format.
